# OpenAI chatGPT's API implementation 

## Don't forget to install the requirements.

* Insert your OpenAI API Key in the .env file
* If needed, change the model to use (Default is GPT-4)
* Run! You can either use the notebook to have the answers for later or run it right away on the terminal using `python chat.py`
